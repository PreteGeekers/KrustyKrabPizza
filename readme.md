* **check-con**
Bobby Martin's script.  Retrieves all cron jobs on the system and outputs them to the terminal (as far as I can tell from one read through).
* **audit**
Run general system and user checks.  Use -c to run cron check
* **immutableChk**
Searches the entire system for immutable files, then asks if you would like to remove the immutable flag.  Should be run as root to avoid permission denied errors
